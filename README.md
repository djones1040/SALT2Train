SALT3 training code
===================

This repo is a refactoring of the SALT training code
for modeling Type Ia supernovae, originally developed by J. Guy.
When using the SALT3 model, please cite: 

Kenworthy et al., 2021, ApJ, submitted.

We are also developing an additional testing and simulation framework.
Please feel free to message us with any questions and see
